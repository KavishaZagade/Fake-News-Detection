# Fake-News-Detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately identify and classify news articles as either "real" or "fake." Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model is trained on a large dataset of news articles to recognize patterns, linguistic cues, and features that distinguish legitimate news from misinformation

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1.  Open the Jupyter Notebook file `LoanApprovalPrediction.ipynb`.
2.  Run all the cells to train the model and see the prediction results.
